This thing has done an incredible job.. We use it upstairs and downstairs.

The positives: it does a pretty good job cleaning. We're all pretty impressed with how well it cleans carpets, rugs, hard floors, etc. Just good all around in regards to cleaning. It doesnt get everything on the first pass and so far it's not been fantastic with baseboards, but it does a pretty good job, all things considered. It's also easy to use and quiet- neither our toddler or dog are freaked out/bothered by its sound. I actually prefer that it doesnt have a "mapping" capability, as that would make using it on two floors more complicated, if not all out impossible.

As far as the negatives, they're so trivial, it doesnt lower this thing down to 4 stars. Still 5 stars all around. So far, this thing has fallen down the stairs, twice. So, its IR abilities, despite us wiping off its front, are not completely up to par. We're still working on a way to ensure she (we've named her beepbop) doesnt fall down the stairs. Now that I think about it, one of her other weaknesses is IR related as well- she's not so great at finding her home. Pretty clunky/awkward about it. We dont really mind when she slows down and turns orange to take her to her spot- but it would be better if she could find that on her own a little better. The last negative is largely comical... and she seems to have a thing for our fan. Part of the problem is the base of the fan is a slight incline, but she doesnt move on.. She just keeps trying to "climb" that base. It's a little awkward.

And for the record, I suspect this thing is better than more than a few robovacs you'd spend 3-4x the $ on, making the value that much more impressive.
